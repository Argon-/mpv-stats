mpv-stats
=========
Display statistics for the currently played file in mpv.

Usage
=====
Place `stats.lua` in your `~/.config/mpv/scripts/` or `~/.mpv/scripts/` folder
to autoload the script.

The script is binding itself to `i` and `I` (however, not overriding your own
bindings) and can therefore be invoked by pressing these keys.
`i` will show the stats once while `I` is toggling them.

You can set different bindings either by customizing this script (see below) or
by using the `script_binding` input command (in `input.conf`), e.g.:

    e script-binding stats/display_stats
    E script-binding stats/display_stats_toggle

By default *Source Sans Pro* is used as font.
[You can download it here](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro).


F.A.Q.
======

### Requirements

This script requires mpv version **18.0** or above.  
An older version (see [Releases](https://github.com/Argon-/mpv-stats/releases))
can be used with a minimum required mpv version of 0.9.3.

There are no further/external dependencies.

### How to get graphs?

Graphs are enabled by default.
Please note that they are only shown when stats are toggled and that only the
`opengl` VO is exposing the necessary data.

Turn them off with `plot_graphs=no` (see [Customization](#customization)).

### Why are my timing values colored?

**Red**: your hardware needs more time to render/present/upload a frame than available.  
**Yellow**: your hardware needs more than 85% of the available time.
This is merely a warning.

When using
[display-resample](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#options-video-sync) and/or
[interpolation](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#video-output-drivers-interpolation)
mpv has to show (render/present/upload) one frame every `1/display-fps` seconds.
In case of a 60Hz display this means there's `1/60 = 0.016666` sec (`16666` Î¼s) time
per frame available.  
Given [display-resample](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#options-video-sync)
is not used the video's FPS will be used for these calculations.
Note that there are further parameters and coherences
(depending on user configuration) influencing fluent playback and this is
just a very general indicator.

Turn it off by setting `timing_warning=no` (see [Customization](#customization)).  
Use `timing_warning_th=0.85` to set a factor determining when to warn (yellow).

### Can I get a sum of all three timing values?

Yes, use `timing_total=yes` to add an additional line showing the values
summed up (see [Customization](#customization)).

### The graph's position is jumping

Please use a font with monospaced digits.
The default font does meet this requirement. Either download it (see [Usage](#usage))
or set your own with `font_mono` (see [Customization](#customization)).  
Note that `font` does not need to be a monospaced font.

### Why does the layout change when showing graphs?

Long story short: there can't be text behind the graph drawings.

Customization
=============
You can configure various settings by creating a file called `stats.conf` in a folder
named `lua-settings` within your mpv config folder (where your `mpv.conf` is in).
Please refer to the `o` table within the script for possible option names and
consult [mpv manual](http://mpv.io/manual/master/#config-syntax) regarding
configuration syntax.

To change e.g. the text display duration your `stats.conf` may look like:

    duration=5

A more sophisticated example:

    key_oneshot=e
    key_toggle=E
    plot_graphs=no
    timing_total=yes
    font=Arial
    font_mono=Monospaced
    font_size=8
    font_color=262626
    border_size=0.5

Note: colors are given as hexadecimal values and use
[ASS tag](http://docs.aegisub.org/3.2/ASS_Tags/#\c) order: BBGGRR (blue green red).
